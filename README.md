Suicide Rate Analysis (2000 - 2020)

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

From growing up in India , I have always wondered what was the factors that play a role in Suicide. There have been a plethora of suicide clusters from my School. This project seeks to explore the underlying factors. We will use a sample of gather data from 37 States/Union Territories, between the 2000 to 2020. We would like to use Machine Learning algorithm to make predictions , where we can train our AI to learn & improve from experience. Thus, we would want to predict the amount of suicides numbers in a certain demographic.

OVERVIEW

Data is collected from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allwynthomas2410/suicides-in-india-from-year-2000-to-2020


In this mini-project, we will perform the following steps -

Exploratory Data Analysis  Machine Learning + Predictive Analytics  Conclusions

What we have performed in this project is:

Total Suicides in India
Total Suicides in India by Cause of Suicide
Total Suicides In India Gender Wise
Total Suicides In India State Wise
Total Suicides In India State-Gender Wise
Predict Suicides in India Using Machine Learning Algorithms
Predict Suicides in India as per the count of male/female Using Linear Regression Algorithm
Predict Suicides in India of Females as per the Male Using Linear Regression Algorithm
